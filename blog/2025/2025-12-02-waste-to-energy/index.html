Traditional fossil-fuel solutions are no longer viable—economically or environmentally. This is where hybrid microgrids powered by renewables and waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies offer a transformative opportunity.</p> <p>Our newly published research, “Cost-Effective Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy and Waste-to-Energy Technologies,” presents a cutting-edge optimization framework designed to build cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable microgrids for regions with limited energy access.</p> <hr> <h2 id="why-we-conducted-this-study">Why We Conducted This Study</h2> <p>Bangladesh, like many developing nations, faces three major hurdles:</p> <ul> <li>Growing electricity demand</li> <li>Dependence on fossil fuels</li> <li>Increasing municipal solid waste</li> </ul> <p>Remote communities such as Halishahar in Chattogram often rely on expensive diesel generators or unstable grid connections. At the same time, the area generates hundreds of tons of waste daily—an untapped energy resource.</p> <p>Our goal was to design a practical, real-world solution that:</p> <ul> <li>Minimizes energy cost</li> <li>Reduces carbon emissions</li> <li>Utilizes local renewable and waste resources</li> <li>Ensures a continuous electricity supply</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2> <p>Our proposed microgrid combines five energy technologies:</p> <ul> <li>Solar PV 🌞</li> <li>Wind Turbines 🌬</li> <li>Waste-to-Energy (FastOx Gasification) ♻️</li> <li>Battery Energy Storage 🔋</li> <li>Diesel Generator (backup only) ⚙️</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/islam2025cost-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/islam2025cost-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/islam2025cost-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/islam2025cost.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> System Diagram. </div> <p>To find the most cost-effective configuration, we applied two advanced optimization algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)</li> <li>Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)</li> <li>We also benchmarked results using HOMER, the industry-standard microgrid design software.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2> <h3 id="1-wte-dramatically-lowers-energy-cost">1.
