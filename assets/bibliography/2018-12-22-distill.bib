  abstract={Microgrids are designed to utilize renewable energy resources (RER) that are revolutionary choices in reducing the environmental effect while producing electricity. The RER intermittency poses technical and economic challenges for the microgrid systems that can be overcome by utilizing the full potential of hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). A microgrid comprising of a solar photovoltaic panel, wind turbine, lead-acid battery, electrolyzer, fuel cell, and hydrogen (H ) tank is considered for techno-economic feasibility and environmental impact assessment on a grid integration scenario. Mathematical functions are utilized to model the components for estimating annual hourly renewable generation and energy storage behavior. The load consumption model for 50 homes is generated using Gaussian distribution to incorporate the uncertainty. Optimal sizing of the microgrid components is determined using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize the upfront installation cost and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Different energy storage penetration scenarios, e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% for the microgrid system, are considered where 100% penetration level stands for maintaining the load demand using the available resources without depending on the grid energy supply. The lowest LCOE is found between 0.06 $/kWh and 0.11 $/kWh, and the highest annual GHG is reduced to half compared to the grid emission. GHG is imposed around 62.14 (tCO2e/yr) - 73.57 (tCO2e/yr) for Madrid and Seville, respectively.},

  abstract={Rising fuel prices, global warming, and environmental damage are leading to increased demand for rooftop solar energy systems connected to the power grid. The development of smart grids, modern metering systems, and energy management could promote energy conservation in households. In this study, two different meta-heuristic optimization techniques were employed to schedule the shiftable load in suitable hours for decreasing electricity costs and minimizing peak to average ratio in a smart home while maintaining optimum user comfort. For power generation and storing energy, a grid-connected residential load with rooftop solar panels, a battery, and an inverter is considered. First, the problem is theoretically described using a load model and an objective function, with the primary goal of reducing power costs by moving the time of usage for certain home appliances. Simulations validate the proposed strategies, which effectively reduce power costs by 4.5% by shifting the time of use, with both optimization algorithms showing similar output. The residential electricity cost before optimization was 507.12 BDT/day, which decreased to 484.33 BDT/day after optimization without compromising load turn-off.},
